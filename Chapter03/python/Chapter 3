          **Explanatory analysis and regression analysis**
                         (Before we used Descriptive analysis now we will use explanatory analysis)
                         (We will use linear regression in this explanatory context, analyze what 
                          attributes of the customer base are highly correlated with 
                          higher conversion rates and item purchases)
                          ( we estimate the output variables via linear combinations of the features)
                          Y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 +b3x3 + b4x4 + ... 
                          (In this chapter, we will discuss how we can use logistic regression models, 
                          to understand what drives higher customer engagement)
